This section of the documentation describes the formula grammar used by
Formulaic. It is almost identical that used by patsy and R, and so most formulas
should work without modification. However, there are some differences, which are
called out below.


## Operators

In this section, we introduce a complete list of the _grammatical_ operators
that you can use in your formulas. They are listed such that each section
(demarcated by "-----") has higher precedence then the block that follows. When
you write a formula involving several operators of different precedence, those
with higher precedence will be resolved first. "Arity" is the number of
arguments the operator takes. Within operators of the same precedence, all
binary operators are evaluated from left to right (they are left-associative).
To highlight differences in grammar betweeh formulaic, patsy and R, we highlight
any differences below. If there is a checkmark the Formulaic, Patsy and R
columns, then the grammar is consistent across all three.

| Operator | Arity | Description | Formulaic | Patsy | R |
|---------:|:-----:|:------------|:---------:|:-----:|:-:|
| `"..."`[^1] | 1 | String literal. | âœ“ | âœ“ | ðŸ—™ |
| `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+`[^1] | 1 | Numerical literal. | âœ“ | ðŸ—™ | ðŸ—™ |
| `` `...` ``[^1] | 1 | Quotes fieldnames within the incoming dataframe, allowing the use of special characters, e.g. `` `my|special$column!` `` | âœ“ | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ |
| `{...}`[^1] | 1 | Quotes python operations, as a more convenient way to do Python operations than `I(...)`, e.g. `` {`my|col`**2} `` | âœ“ | ðŸ—™ | ðŸ—™ |
| `<function>(...)`[^1] | 1 | Python transform on column, e.g. `my_func(x)` which is equivalent to `{my_func(x)}` | âœ“[^2] | âœ“ | ðŸ—™ |
|-----|
| `(...)` | 1 | Groups operations, overriding normal precedence rules. All operations with the parentheses are performed before the result of these operations is permitted to be operated upon by its peers. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
|-----|
| ** | 2 | Expands into the product of the left operand with itself n times, where n is the (integral) value of the right operand. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| ^ | 2 | Alias for `**`. | ðŸ—™ | ðŸ—™[^3] | âœ“ |
|-----|
| `:` | 2 | Adds a new term that corresponds to the product of the elementwise product of its operands. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `%in%` | 2 | Alias for `:`. | ðŸ—™ | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ |
|-----|
| `*` | 2 | Expands to the addition of a new term for each operand as well as their interactinon, i.e. `a * b` is equivalent to `a + b + a:b`. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `/` | 2 | Expands to the addition of a new term for the left operand and the interaction of all left operand terms with the right operand, i.e `a / b` is equivalent to `a + a:b`, `(a + b) / c` is equivalent to `a + b + a:b:c`, and `a/(b+c)` is equivalent to `a + a:b + a:c`.[^4] | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
|-----|
| `+` | 2 | Adds a new term to the set of features. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `-` | 2 | Removes a term from the set of features (if present). | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `+` | 1 | Returns the current term unmodified (not very useful). | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `-` | 1 | Negates a term (only implemented for 0, in which case it is replaced with `1`). | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
|-----|
| `~` | 1,2 | Separates the target features from the input features. If absent, it is assumed that we are considering only the the input features. Unless otherwise indicated, it is assumed that the input features implicitly include an intercept. | âœ“[^5] | âœ“ | âœ“ |


## Transforms

Formulaic has not yet garnered implementations for many transforms, but the
framework fully supports them, including preservation of state so that new data
can undergo the same transformation as that used during modelling.

| Transform | Description | Formulaic | Patsy | R |
|----------:|:------------|:---------:|:-----:|:-:|
| `I(...)` | Identity transform, allowing arbitrary Python/R operations, e.g. `I(x+y)`. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `C(...)` | Categorically encode a column, e.g. `C(x)` | partial[^6] | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `center(...)` | Shift column data so mean is zero. | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `scale(...)` | Shift column so mean is zero and variance is 1. | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `standardize(...)` | Alias of `scale`. | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ | ðŸ—™ |
| `bs(...)` | Generates a B-Spline basis, allowing non-linear fits. | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `cr(...)` | Generates a natural cubic spline basis, allowing non-linear fits. | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `cc(...)` | Generates a cyclic cubic spline basis, allowing non-linear fits. | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| `te(...)` | Generates a tensor product smooth. | ðŸ—™ | âœ“ | âœ“ |


## Behaviours and Conventions

Beyond the formula operator grammar itself there are some differing behaviours
and conventions of which you should be aware.

  - Formulaic follows Patsy in that both sides of the `~` operator are treated
    identically. In R, the left hand side is treated as R code rather than
    following the above grammar. In Formulaic and Patsy, the only difference
    between the sides is that an intercept is automatically added to the
    right side. You can recover R's behaviour nesting the operations in a Python
    operator block (as described in the operator table): `{y1 + y2} ~ a + b`.
    Note that the enhanced `Formula` R package also uses this convention.
  - Formula terms in Formulaic are always sorted first by the order of the
    interaction, and then alphabetically. In R and patsy, this second ordering
    is done in the order that columns were introduced to the formula (patsy
    additionally sorts by which fields are involved in the interactions). As a
    result formulas with the same set of fields will always generate the same
    model matrix.
  - Formulaic follows patsy's more rigourous handling of whether or not to
    include an intercept term. In R, `b-1` and `(b-1)` both do not have an
    intercept, whereas in Formulaic and Patsy the parentheses are resolved first
    and so the first does not have an intercept and the second does (because
    and implicit '1 +' is added prepended to the right hand side of the
    formula).
  - Formulaic carefully chooses where to reduce the rank of the model matrix
    in order to ensure that the matrix is structurally full rank. It uses the
    same algorithm as patsy. This avoids producing over-specified model
    matrices in contexts that R would (since it only considers local full-rank
    structure, rather than global structure). You can read more about this in
    [Patsy's documentation](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formulas.html).


[^1]: This "operator" is actually part of the tokenisation process.
[^2]: Formulaic additionally supports quoted fields with special characters, e.g. `` my_func(`my|special+column`) ``.
[^3]: The caret operator is not supported, but will not cause an error. It is ignored by the patsy formula parser, and treated as XOR Python operation on column.
[^4]: This somewhat confusing operator is useful when you want to include hierachical features in your data, and where certain interaction terms do not make sense (particularly in ANOVA contexts). For example, if `a` represents countries, and `b` represents cities, then the full product of terms from `a * b === a + b + a:b` does not make sense, because any value of `b` is guaranteed to coincide with a value in `a`, and does not independently add value. Thus, the operation `a / b === a + a:b` results in more sensible dataset. As a result, the `/` operator is right-distributive, since if `b` and `c` were both nested in `a`, you would want `a/(b+c) === a + a:b + a:c`. Likewise, the operator is not left-distributive, since if `c` is nested under both `a` and `b` separately, then you want `(a + b)/c === a + b + a:b:c`. Lastly, if `c` is nested in `b`, and `b` is nested in `a`, then you would want `a/b/c === a + a:(b/c) === a + a:b + a:b:c`.
[^5]: Formulaic additionally supports more than one `~` which splits the features into as many groups as you like.
[^6]: Formulaic only supports one-hot encoding, and does not yet support arbitrary contrast matrices or specification which field to leave out in reduced rank, etc.
